What Is Version Control?
A system called version control, sometimes referred to as source control or revision control,
 keeps track of changes made to a file or group of files over time so that you may retrieve particular versions at a later time.
 Although it can be applied to any circumstance where several versions of something are made and may need to be monitored and recalled, 
it is most frequently employed in software development.
